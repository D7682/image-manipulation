# image-manipulation

Simplified Version of the Algorithm's Steps:
1. the program checks if the examples folder already exists and creates one if it does not
2. the program continues to retreive two random images from the internet
3. dimensions of each image are retreived in order to create a new rectangle
4. the image is combined with information about each image's dimensions
5. the information is stored in memory and then drawn onto the previous rectangle
6. a new file is created with a random name
7. the program draws the information from memory into the newly created file
8. the file is then closed and saved into the examples folder.
